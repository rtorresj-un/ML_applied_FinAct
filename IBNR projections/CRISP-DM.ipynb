    "## Business understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this document is to present a robust methodology for reserving forecasting which is an essential part of insurance business. In particular, the proposal is presented to All Nation Insurance Co. which is a large size insurer based in Miami, FL, the objective of this firm is to provide insurance for NY residents & businesses, Auto, Home & Business Insurance at low rates, and with a top notch service. Our purpose is to support that mission with data mining and analitycs solutions, bringing our customers the best suggestions, forecasts and outlooks to take properly informed solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are focusing on auto insurance products, defined by a contract (or policy) in which insurer takes the obligation (liability) to respond on car losses of the insured in case of a claim caused by a sinister. The pricing of the policy depends on risks asocciated with car model, insured profiling, market bemchmarks, type and extension of coverage, and other insurer's operational costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, the insurers are seeking for the best information that could allow a better risk asessment in order to correctly manage liabilities. From a financial perspective, every policy that an insurer takes must have an adequate reserve in case the contract is executed. The benefit of the company comes from the inexecution of claims and is always a win to win for both parts as insured hedge from financial risks that could arise from possible car accidents. As regards the latter, the machine learning methodologies are striking insuring industry with outstanding performance of reserves forecasting over traditional procedures and this is the value offer that we are offering to this company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the objectives, quality criteria, procedures, budgeting, requirements, duration, analysis and results are provided for discussion as an offering of analytics services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statement of Business Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of the project is to create a forecasting model on provisions for insurance companies. First, let's see some concepts related:\n",
    "\n",
    "The insurance business is to offer benefits for covering several types of risks. This benefits are paid to the insured (or customer) in form of periodic payments (or premiums) when the determined claim takes place. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Claims dynamics: Premiums refer to the regular payments that an insured person makes to the insurance company to keep their coverage active. The development of a claim requires time. The presence of this delay in the processing of a claim forces the insurer to have capital to settle these claims in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The inverted production cycle of the insurance market and the claim dynamics motivate the need for reserving and the design of predictive modeling tools to estimate reserves. In insurance, the premium income precedes the costs. An insurer will charge a client a premium, before actually knowing how costly the insurance policy or contract will become. In typical manufacturing industry this is not the case and the manufacturer knows - before selling a product - what the cost of producing this product was. At a specified evaluation moment the insurer will predict outstanding liabilities with respect to contracts sold in the past. This is the claims reserve or loss reserve; it is the capital necessary to settle open claims from past exposures. It is a very important element on the balance sheet of the insurer, more specifically on the liabilities side of the balance sheet, as could be a large source of costs that could be determinant for a company's financial results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statement of Data Mining Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "- The objective of data mining procedure is to establish a solid base from where the diagnosis, modeling techniques and conclusions could be accurately and useful for the business. Particularly, the building of provisions data base includes identificaiton of claims, reserves and costs associated to insurances issued from 1987 to 1997, which are covering 10 year span of development of benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data mining procedure will be used as source of information for the development of Machine Learning forecasting techniques which are intended to improve an industry standard, most known as the *chain ladder method*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statement of Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "As the business needs are related directly with the liabilities optimization, diminishing costs and making a more efficient use of capital resources, next are presented tow main indicators of the project's contributions: \n",
    "\n",
    "- In line with the data mining objective, the success criteria must be determined by the improvement of backtesting metrics compared to the base model mentioned before, or proving that standard method is significantly better than any other. \n",
    "\n",
    "- As well as the data analysis and business understanding is useful for modelling purposes, any relevant conclusion in this way must be included in results and could be a success measurement of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focuses on understanding the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective, then converting this knowledge into a data mining problem definition and a preliminary plan designed to achieve the objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Situation Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, the insurance company has access to all data on claims and commercial auto insurance on sector, such as premium values, claim values, accident dates, cumulative paid losses, and assigned expenses. Currently, the insurance company has the required professionals and staff to complete the data mining project, as it has experts in reserve calculations and qualified personnel in data mining methodologies. The major risks of the project include implementing a method that performs worse than the traditional method, leading to poor solvency and potential financial difficulties for the company. The contingency plan is to abandon the data mining model if the objectives are not met annually and quickly revert to using the traditional Chain-Ladder method.\n",
